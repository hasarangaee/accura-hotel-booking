I will focus on setting up a robust authentication and authorization system with role-based access control (RBAC) on both the backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (React.js). We'll ensure the following:

traget coding level

Backend:
Implement JWT-based authentication.
Implement role-based authorization (e.g., Admin, Hotel Admin, Guest).
Provide endpoints for signup, login, creating hotels, creating rooms, and booking rooms.
Use MySQL for database management.
Secure the API endpoints based on user roles.

Frontend:
Manage authentication state using React Context.
Implement role-based access control for different routes.
Provide a UI for signup, login, creating hotels, creating rooms, and booking rooms.
Ensure any guest can book a room without logging in.

username : admin | 
passwod : admin

Test.....
